# Customer Service AI Agent — Agentic AI Apps

This branch presents a **Customer Service AI Agent** implementation in the *Agentic AI Apps* collection.  
It demonstrates how to build a conversational support agent that can understand user queries, handle ticket-style workflows, escalate or route as needed, and maintain context across turns — all in an agentic architecture.

### 1. **Clone the repository** and switch to this branch:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rebase-master/agentic-ai-apps.git
   cd agentic-ai-apps
   git checkout customer-service-ai-agent
```

### 2. Set up your Python environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # macOS / Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
```

### 3. Configure environment variables, e.g.:

`export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"`


### 4. Launch the notebook:

`jupyter notebook`

## 🧩 How It Works (Design & Architecture)

### Agentic Flow & Routing

#### 1. User Input → Intent Detection
The system classifies incoming messages (e.g. “order status,” “refund request,” “policy question,” or “chit-chat”).

#### 2. Routing to Sub-Agents / Tools
Depending on intent, the agent dispatches to:
- A Support / Ticket Agent (for order, refund, issue lookup)
- A FAQ / Knowledge Agent (for general support questions)
- A Fallback / Small Talk Agent (for chit-chat or unrecognized queries)

#### 3. Tool Invocation & Response Composition
Each agent uses specialized tools or modules (e.g. database lookup, external APIs, knowledge retrieval) to fetch or update data, then crafts a natural-language response.

#### 4. Context & Memory Management
Maintains state across turns so that users can reference prior tickets, ask follow-ups, or clarify details.

#### 5. Fallbacks & Escalation
If the system can’t confidently resolve a query, it escalates to a human placeholder or asks clarifying questions.

## 🔧 Core Components & Tools
| Component                       | Role                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SupportAgent / TicketAgent**  | Handles queries like “Where’s my order?”, “I want a refund”, creates or updates tickets           |
| **FAQAgent / KBAgent**          | Answers general support questions from a knowledge base                                           |
| **FallbackAgent / SmallTalk**   | Handles out-of-scope conversational prompts and keeps the dialogue engaging                       |
| **Routing Module / Dispatcher** | Analyzes user intent and delegates to the proper agent                                            |
| **Tool Wrappers**               | Interfaces to databases, APIs, or internal modules (e.g. `get_order_status()`, `create_ticket()`) |
| **Prompt Templates**            | Standardized instruction templates for each agent (e.g. few-shot examples, system instructions)   |


## 🔍 Example Use Cases
- Order Status Query
User: “What’s the status of order #12345?”
→ Routed to TicketAgent → fetch order info → respond with current status.

- Refund / Return Request
User: “I want to return my product”
→ TicketAgent validates return policy + issues return ticket.

- General Support Question
User: “How long does shipping take?”
→ FAQAgent looks up from knowledge base → responds with policy.

- Chit-chat / Greeting
User: “Hello, how are you?”
→ FallbackAgent replies with conversational content.

## 🛠️ Extending & Customizing
- Add new support domains (e.g. billing, subscription) by creating domain agents and integrating into the routing layer.
- Plug in real backend systems (support ticket APIs, databases, CRM tools).
- Expand knowledge base with structured data, embeddings, or vector search for better FAQ handling.
- Improve fallback logic — e.g. asking clarifying questions, user confirmation, human handoff.
- Introduce session management, user authentication, rate-limiting, and monitoring.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations & Notes

- This is a prototype / proof-of-concept — not production-grade.
- The notebook-centric structure is ideal for experimentation; production deployment will require modularizing and packaging into services.
- The agent’s behavior heavily depends on prompt design, tool definitions, and fallback rules.
- No built-in scalability, auditing, or logging currently — you may add these for robustness.
