## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains a collection of **agentic AI applications and prototypes** that explore how AI agents can collaborate, reason, and perform complex workflows using various frameworks and techniques — such as **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and custom multi-agent orchestration.

Each branch in this repository represents a **self-contained AI project**, built to demonstrate different problem-solving capabilities — from order handling and customer service to summarization and product Q&A systems.

## 🌿 Repository Structure

Each project lives on a separate branch to keep implementations modular and independent.

| Branch | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| [`customer-service-ai-agent`](https://github.com/rebase-master/agentic-ai-apps/tree/customer-service-ai-agent) | A conversational **customer service AI agent** capable of handling user queries, managing support tickets, and simulating real-world customer interaction workflows. |
| [`multi-agent-systems-with-langgraph`](https://github.com/rebase-master/agentic-ai-apps/tree/multi-agent-systems-with-langgraph) | A **multi-agent orchestration system** built using **LangGraph**, where different specialized agents (Product, Orders, Small Talk) collaborate to process user requests intelligently. |
| [`orders-chatbot-with-custom-agent`](https://github.com/rebase-master/agentic-ai-apps/tree/orders-chatbot-with-custom-agent) | A **custom AI agent chatbot** that manages product orders — capable of updating, tracking, and summarizing order data through conversational inputs. |
| [`product-qna-agentic-chatbot`](https://github.com/rebase-master/agentic-ai-apps/tree/product-qna-agentic-chatbot) | An **Agentic Q&A chatbot** designed to answer user questions about products using a retrieval-augmented approach (RAG) and structured reasoning. |
| [`summary-chatbot-with-reviewer`](https://github.com/rebase-master/agentic-ai-apps/tree/summary-chatbot-with-reviewer) | A **summarization chatbot** enhanced with a **reviewer agent** that validates and refines generated summaries for higher factual accuracy. |
